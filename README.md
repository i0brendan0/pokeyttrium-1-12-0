## What is this hack

    Introducing the SkÃ¥ne Region based off of Scandinavia.
    You play as a Noland or Lucy (Not Implemented), a retired Frontier Brain from Hoenn who still
    wants to be a Pokemon Trainer. You move to a new region where no one really knows who you are.
    Along the way to completing the regional Pokemon League, you eventually come across a group of
    individuals who are set on changing the status quo. (Story Not Implemented)
    
    DUE TO LUCY'S SPRITE DATA NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED, IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO PLAY AS LUCY.
    
    The region has no Pokemon Professor, but you'll meet a friendly face to start off your journey.

### pokeemerald Expansion configuration changes

    - Critical hits do 2x damage instead of 1.5x.
    - Trainers give boosted EXP compared to wild Pokemon.
    - Pokemon receive split EXP instead of full EXP if multiple participated.
    - Pokemon do not get a bonus to EXP when above the level they would evolve at.

    - Hidden Power uses IVs to determine power.
    - Rough Skin/Iron Barb damage is 1/16th instead of 1/8th.
